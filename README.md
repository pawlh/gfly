# gfly

This project is inspired by [Strava Flyby](https://labs.strava.com/flyby/). After seeing the Flyby of an [old run](https://labs.strava.com/flyby/viewer/#1796543763?c=9x0e31v8&z=C&t=1RWKmW), I thought it would be neat to be able to do something similar on a much larger scale using Google's Location History data from Google Takeout.

## Planned Milestones
- [ ] basic CLI listing spatial and temporal collissions 
- [ ] automated trimming of redudant records in .json exports
- [ ] caching of .json exports
- [ ] web interface with map frame
